Perhaps the warm toddy, which was always at hand, assisted a little with the marvelous tales related. However, when all was quiet in doors and out, as far as could be with the various teams feeding by the wagons, suddenly a succession of piercing shrieks came from the stable yard, and every wagoner who had been snoring to his heart’s content on his separate mattress sprang to his feet, and, rushing to the door, saw a wild scene of confusion going on in the yard and in front of the old tavern. Horses were prancing, … upsetting the feed trough and tangled in the harness or fastenings of their companions on the other side, while shriek after shriek of a most startling nature came from a dark corner in the yard near which the dense woods terminated. Some even claimed they saw a white object of various dimensions, but the narrator said he lost no time in investigating, but, with others, hastily rolled up his mattress, attached his horses to the wagon, and, after settling his sore with the landlord…started out into the night, although it neared ‘the witching time of night when churchyards yawn, etc’ and did not again draw rein until he arrived at the next stopping place.""

40th Street and Lancaster Ave., 43rd Street and Lancaster Ave.,and 52nd and Lancaster Ave.",None,"The Philadelphia General Strike of 1910

In mid-February of 1910 angry trolley workers began rioting following the breakdown of negotiations between trolley workers and PRT (Pennsylvania Rapid Transit) and PRT's refusal to unionize. Riots broke out all over the city with Lancaster Avenue being host to a good deal of the violence. An article in the Philadelphia Inquirer reads: ""Cars were attacked and clashes occurred between the police and mobs at Fifty-second and Lancaster avenue...cars were wrecked at Forty-third street and Lancaster avenue, Fortieth and Lancaster avenue...William Janz, a ""strike-breaking"" motorman, whose home is in New York, was probably fatally injured by a brick striking him on the head when his car was attacked by rioters...""

 From a basic standpoint, the general strike marks a shift in the balance of power in labor. The size of the strike shows that these workers were no longer willing to let the PRT continue to ignore their concerns. Yet, the fact that strike became a series of riots and that extreme violence that took place unmask an incredibly dark side of modernity. The workers achieved their goals in the end, but at the price of injuring others and destroying parts of the city.",4,5,"“Many Are Injured in Series of Riots.” The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Second, the discussion of domestic violence, negligence, and illegal activities through persons such as Connaghan (Image: Unsavory Persons)  in addition to the list of raided speakeasies reveals the modern preoccupation with alcohol and its association with vice and social ills.

","Built 1893, finished 1895","""With the passing of Wistar Morris in 1887, parcels of his land (which had been in the family since the original land grants of William Penn in the late 1600's) were sold to several individuals. In 1889 the Childs and Drexel Syndicate purchased from the Morris family and other adjacent landowners the area now included between 58th Street and 66th Street, City Line and Woodbine Avenue. This suburban, or more accurately, rural area called Overbrook Farms, was to be developed into a gracious community of large custom-built homes. In 1890, such a large undertaking was a bold innovation. By 1893, the developers realized that no real community would ever develop without sufficient churches. So they offered land to several denominations with the condition for each that a stone church would be erected within one year at a cost of not less than $25,000 – equivalent to perhaps millions with the economic situation as it is. This proposal was made for purely business reasons.
 
""During these same years a number of Catholic families had purchased homes in Overbrook farms. And in those Victorian times of large household staffs, many members of these staffs were Catholics. Both groups found the trip to the parish church, Our Lady of the Rosary, at 63rd and Callowhill Streets, quite arduous, and frequently in winter almost impossible. They therefore petitioned Archbishop Ryan on several occasions to erect a chapel closer to this new community.
 
""Thus, by early 1894, these two groups, prompted by quite different if not opposite motives, inspired the Archbishop to appoint the young curate at St. Agatha's parish in West Philadelphia, the Rev. James A. Mullin, as founding pastor of the new parish in Overbrook, St. Mary Magdalene's. The date was April 14, 1894.""",4,2,"Google Street View

Historicality becomes vacated in order to create an ideal, simultaneously rooted in the past yet materializing in the future. Figures are mythologized through atrophied accounts of their lives in order to convey the sort of beings which we should aim at becoming. The lives of men become signifiers and the signified becomes a product of dominant values. That which doesn't fit these mythologies is hidden away in the nooks of history.

For this I had only my own smattering and desultory habit of mind to blame and also a vivid troublesome sense of the beauty of it all. The charm of the prismatic fringe round the edges made juggling with the lens too tempting, and a clear persistent focus was never attained. Considered (oddly enough) by my mates as the pattern of a diligent scholar, I was in reality as idle as the idlest of them, which is saying much; though I confess that my dilettantism was not wholly disreputable. My mind excellently exhibited the Heraclitean doctrine: a constant flux of information passed through it, but nothing remained. Indeed, my senses were so continually crammed with new enchanting impressions, and every field of knowledge seemed so alluring, it was not strange I made little progress in any.” Idleness disguised as diligent scholarship: dilettantism. Morley plays a transparent medium for knowledge to pass through without leaving a trace. Compare mediumship to collecting and capitalist accumulation—and keep in mind that Morley denies progress.

Around 37th Street and Pearl Avenue, West Philadelphia",November 1915,"A newspaper clipping reporting the street battle between a local cat (whose residence was on Lancaster Avenue around 37th street) and an owl over a rat. 
The cat was returning from a stable with his recent kill when the owl swooped in. The cat fought gallantly, but the owl managed to wrestle the rat away, taking (injured) wing to the trees above. When the neighbors discovered the wounded cat, he was missing an eye and chunks of skin. 

This situation is too hilarious and silly for words. It becomes more hilarious when one compares it to the romantic rendezvous between an owl and cat in the famous Edward Lear poem ""The Owl and the Pussycat"", which, by the way, was published 45 years before this incident. 
In all seriousness, the struggle between a domesticated cat and a wild bird of prey seems to speak to the struggle between man (in the form of modern urbanization) and nature. Modernity and urban sprawl has created the domesticated cat that stalks the alleyways and wild animals that have no choice but to navigate the urban sprawl that has encroached on their habitat.

Chester Springs",1920,"Painting by American Modernist Alice Neel in response to her child's death.

Story of child's death goes from Philadelphia to Cuba and back again. Does she or her lover meet Antonio Guiteras along the way?

Alice meets Carlos Enriquez at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Art's summer school in Chester Springs. They soon marry and return to Havana to live with Enriquez family,  where they are welcomed by the blossoming cuban avant-garde movement. They live with Enriquez wealthy family, though return to the States after the birth of their first child, who soon dies of diphtheria. 

Enriquez famous artist in his own right. Flee's to Cuba with couple's second daughter in 1930, severing contact, though the couple never officially divorced and never does. 

In response Alice suffers a nervous breakdown, tries to kill herself, and spends the next 18 months in Philadelphia insane asylum. Upon release she becomes one of the first American artists to take part in the Work's Progress Administration, and is hired to paint a new piece every six weeks. 

Spends rest of life as communist sympathiser and bohemian artist, appears in film with Allen Ginsberg, awarded National Woman's Caucus for Art Award by then President Jimmy Carter and and dies just as she rises to critical acclaim. 

Why is she interesting?

-Father accountant for Pennsylvania Railroad, which serves as major conduit of wealth along the Mainline

You are luckier now than we were then; you don’t even have to go as far as Leary’s (though still worth going to) or Mr. McCawley, a true paramour of print, is close by. I’m even hoping that some day he’ll add an annex of second-hand books so that we may have our own Paul’s Churchyard and Paternoster Row. In my time there was a reprehended haunt of erring spirits, the Red Lion in Ardmore; since, I believe, amalgamated into the Autocar factory. How much better intoxicant does a bookstore offer. ‘Sweet God,’ cried Cobden Sanderson, ‘souse me in literature.’ “It is the ebriety without crastine grief.” It was not—no, it does not look like coincidence that the ad for McCawley's bookshop would boast its possession of Morley's <em>Haunted Book Shop</em>—see the picture attached.<br /><br /><span><span>However: “So the man who collects books not merely for the sentimental accident of edition, but for the quality of thought they bring him, has something more than amenity to consider.

",1937,"Bryn Mawr Summer School Student Marion Jackson's Personal Autobiography, ""It Set Me Thinking,"" 1937. While Jackson initially thought she was ""awakened"" to the true meaning of a Bryn Mawr education from the welcoming lectures by deans and professors, it turns out through collective sharing within the dorm environment, she realizes her own unique awakening:

""I was walking through the hall in Denbigh on Tuesday afternoon when the girl in room 13 called to me. She wanted to know what I could tell her about the Scottsboro case and about Angelo Herndon, the Negro organizer. I am a Negro; still I was forced to confess that there was very little I could tell her. Many of us feel that the Negro problem is a tremendous one and we feel so helpless in regard to it that we take the easiest way out and shut our eyes to much of the real suffering of our people. Of course, we know that is the wrong way to look  upon the matter; but then too often we feel that we are only one tenth of the population, and that is a very small minority, then the girl in room 13 reminded me of the fact that nearly 90 percent of the Negro population were workers, and the workers are the masses. Therefore we need only to unite our forces and we will bring about a better treatment of conditions for all. Through unity of forces we can break down race discrimination and class discrimination.
I am glad my sister student called me into her room that day. She set me thinking in an entirely different direction. I no longer think in terms of dollars and cents. I think in terms of what I can do for my class and my race. I feel that I too can do my part, be it ever too small. I feel that I will have accomplished a great deal if I am able to convince other Negroes that we as a race must stop sitting down and taking it on the chin, so to speak.
We must stop looking for the path of easiness, for we must face facts and learn truths—know the cause in order to find a cure.
I intend therefore on returning home to connect myself with the National Negro Congress and to learn Negro history, since what education I do have I have received in the public schools and any favorable facts pertaining to the Negro were very intentionally omitted.
I have then to take Bryn Mawr for putting me on the right track.
I have Bryn Mawr to thank for making me race and class conscious.”

This chance encounter is crucial for Jackson's own awakening process. However, it should be noted that what Jackson takes from this chance encounter, this communal coming together of minds, is not the implicitly white (or at least non-black) student's exact doctrine of how class and race ought to operate. In her criticism of this narrative, Karyn Hollis notes that there is a break between the Room 13 girl's idea of race concerns as assimilated into a greater class narrative, versus Jackson's distinct division between the two. A sense of skepticism for the dominant narrative of history is then therefore imparted on how she shares with others. Veiled histories and truth of experience. Subjectivity as necessary to understand individual and collective. ∆Thesis on the Philosophy of History∆",8,3,"Hollis, Karyn.

A published report from the orphanage's Board of Managers recounts the rise in health issues among the boys and heiress Louisa Gratz's charitable loan of her country estate to the orphanage. The boys and the nuns stayed at the mansion for a few weeks.

Despite the amusing image of a mansion filled with orphan boy, the origins of the benefactor prove to be the most interesting part of this story. Louisa Gratz was not just any heiress, but, as her obituary states, the daughter of prominent Jewish businessman Simon Gratz. She was also the niece of Rebecca Gratz, one of Philadelphia's leading philanthropists and educators in the early 19th century. So, not only did a rich woman help orphans, but also a prominent Jewish family crossed religious lines to help a Catholic organization.",10,5,"“Almost a Centenarian: The Death of Miss Louisa Gratz at the Advanced Age of 89.” Philadelphia Inquirer.

Construction of the Railroad in Malvern",None,"In the summer of 1832, 57 irish immigrant workers died during the construction of the railroad within a six week span. 

 ""Two of the skulls discovered had damage consistent with blunt-force trauma, which calls into question reports that everyone in the crew fell victim to the widespread Asiatic cholera outbreak that ravaged Philadelphia that summer. Archival research, a long-covert railroad file and the subsequent archeological discoveries all point to the possibility that anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiment and violence were directed at the men, who would’ve been exotic threats to the locals. Even more shockingly, the railroad itself may have acted to halt the spread of cholera by preemptively killing the infected, figuring the men were expendable and untraceable, and the assailants’ crimes erasable—with fill.""

These workers were anonymously buried along the tracks. These deaths ""were seen as unfortunate casualties of progress,"" as if the tides of progress possess some sort of inertia that justifies the deaths of these men. Here, progress is founded on the lives of the 'othered' and subjugated laborer who remains anonymous and is condemned to the shadows of history.

",1887-now,"In 1887, J. Johnson Brown owned the plot of land straddling Lancaster Ave. and the St. David's/Villanova exit of the Blue Route.  The estate house, ""Vanor,"" sat on the property North of Lancaster Ave. To the south of the turnpike, the estate included several acres of undeveloped forest which still exist today.

Between 1900 and 1908, the estate went through two major changes. First, it passed to J. Johnson's daughter Martha M. Brown, who co-owned the property with Mary J. Chew. Second, the Philadelphia & Western Railway Company (founded 1902) built a line that ran through the forest to the south of the turnpike.

By 1937, the land had passed fully into the Chew family's hands. The estate was split up and portions were owned by Oswald and Ada K. Chew. The P&W railroad still ran through the forest, owned by Oswald.

SEPTA acquired P&W through various mergers in the following decades, converting one line into the R100. The line through the forest was abandoned in the early fifties and has since been reclaimed by nature. Today, as you walk through the woods, you come across a steep ridge running parallel to Lancaster Ave. roughly 300 feet to the south. A large cement tunnel betrays the ridge's manmade origin (the ridge would otherwise run straight through Ithan creek). On the top, no trace of the railway can be found -- not a single tie, track, or rail remains.

The land is now owned by the Radnor School district.

St. John's Orphan Asylum, 49th St. and Wyalusing Ave",ca. 1945-1950,"Important nuances to note in this experience:

1). Not all children were brought to orphanages because both parents were dead or unaccounted for. Parents often brought their children to orphanages, or the government took children away and placed them with orphanages because of poverty, neglect, and addiction.
2). The experience of an orphan's childhood: army-like discipline is the norm instead of the usual parental love and discipline, e.g. the dorm existence, nuns barking orders.
3) The phantasmagoria of arriving at the orphanage. Orphans were not allowed to leave the grounds of St. John's. This conjures the image of cloistered and victimized fairy tale characters like Rapunzel. Perhaps the nuns are the witches that keep them there?

St. John's Orphan Asylum , 49th St. and Wyalusing Ave.",ca. 1950-1956,"Unlike Robert Hurst (See the entry An Orphan of Circumstance.), Clancy speaks of St. John’s with absolute nostalgia. The span of time from Thanksgiving to Christmas was especially nostalgic, according to the article, because “The Knights of Columbus would serve Thanksgiving dinner. Students from Villanova College would take the boys into town to see the wonders of John Wanamaker’s, Lit Brothers, Gimbel’s, or Strawbridge and Clothier; buy them a gift and treat them to dinner at the Horn & Hardart’s Automat. And of course, there were always holiday carols.” In addition, Clancy fondly remembers his stays with the host family during the holidays: “My memories of spending Christmas, Easter holidays and summer vacations with the Macatees are especially nostalgic and I have had a close relationship with that family ever since.” 
Further, Clancy denies that he grew up deprived or traumatized, claiming instead that he had a good childhood. When questioned about his opinion the criticism of orphanages, he answers, “Was I unfortunate …? Not hardly! Not when I review the ravages of our drug-infested society, particularly among inner-city youths, and the scourge it has placed upon us as a nation. Not when we witness the utter deprivement of little children whose psyches are wrecked by the proliferation of divorce, or broken homes, or child abuse from emotionally troubled parents, or in some cases to be brutally mutilated or even killed. Add to this the unsettling trauma of abortion and it becomes a pretty sordid state of affairs we find in our midst.” 

It is worthwhile to note that this article appears on website for Catholic news in the Philadelphia. A reading of the full article does reveal a bias towards an overly positive view of Catholic orphanages, not only through Clancy’s nostalgic testimony, but also by dismissing criticism of the orphanage upbringing as “common misconceptions”.

None,1971,"""A comparative newcomer to the study of Philippine ornis, he has amassed at the Delaware Museum of Natural History, which he founded, one of the finest collections of Philippine birds in existence. Of course, some specimens are absent, as they would be in any museum, but Mr. duPont has diligently sought them out in other institutions. He has also led significant expeditions in the Philippines, starting in 1958; and anyone who knows John duPont will realize that once in the islands, he heads for the nearest mountains and jungles: he is not one to dawdle about in the gardens of local officials.""(vi)


Thus reads the penultimate paragraph of the forward to John Eleuthere duPont's book, Philippine Birds, published in 1971. At first glance the almost 500 page tome dedicated to pictures and descriptions of the birds of the Philippines (scans attached), seems to offer little insight into the author himself. However, unpacking the sheer existence of this book makes possible a value entry into the man that is John duPont.

""A comparative newcomer,"" duPont is not a traditional academic. This book, the first of a number he writes, is published by the Delaware Museum of Natural History, a museum he himself financed and founded. Furthermore, duPont ""has also led significant expeditions in the Philippines,"" horizontally integrating all aspects of the academic process, self financing every step from research through publication. Perhaps to be understood as a selfless dedication to Nscience this domination over every level of production is undoubtedly somewhat strange. What drives a man to build a home for his own findings, to build a publishing house for his own distribution. Much like the nouveau rich buying their way into class and fame, duPont can be seen as buying himself into the world of ornthology, yet far from being nouveau riche duPont comes from old money, but not old academic prestige. 


Furthermore the last sentence, that duPont heads straight to the mountains and is ""not one to dawdle about,"" seems to do little more than pander to duPont's own self image. It seems difficult to read narcissism out of an anthology of birds yet there appears no other way to understand this strange tome. ",10,4,"Philippine Birds, John Eleuthere du Pont,  Delaware Museum of Natural History; 1st edition (1971)",Philippine Birds: reading narcissism from a book of birds,2014-11-05T02:36:08+00:00,3,collections,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/collections/3,None,False,1,files,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/files?item=235,235,20,Thing,item_types,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/item_types/20,2014-12-03T16:39:41+00:00,3,users,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/users/3,True,book,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/items/235
None,1971,"""The Philippines, notwithstanding their close association over the years with the United States, are not yet within the ken of the recently popular organized bird tours. This is unfortunate, because the rich tropical forests on which the choicer elements in the animal and plant life of these islands depend is being destroyed at an appalling rate. When timber is being slashed off and shipped, not merely to factories in the Philippines but to the United States and Japan, what can be expected? A legacy of erosion and floods will follow to haunt later generations; meanwhile the wildlife is gone forever. But while the islands remain off the beaten track of the bird tours, who can speak out against the unnatural pillage? If the present publication can help to halt such trends, even in a small way, it will be one of its most important services"" (vi).

Thus concludes the forward to John duPont's book, Philippine Birds, a weighty tome documenting the ornithological diversity of the Philippines. This single paragraph, appearing on one of three pages not dedicated to pictures or descriptions of exotic birds, contains referents to two of the great evils of capitalism, the subjugation of people and the subjugation of the environment. The entire violent, ugly, history of relations between the U.S. and the Philippines is wrapped up in the single sentence: ""The Philippines, notwithstanding their close association over the years with the United States."" This exemplifies Benjamin's concept of history, notably that the past cannot be delineated from the present. Historical violence bleeds into dry forwards of bird anthologies. 

How does this allusion of physical human violence compare to the actual description of ""timber being slashed off,"" the violence inflicted upon the environment in the name of industry, played out through the destruction of the habitats of the birds duPont set out to classify?

This acknowledgement of environmental destruction thus completes the metaphorical cycle that brought John duPont to the Philippines to write this book in the first place. The existence of this book, the wealth requisite to fund duPont's foray into ornithology, is predicated upon an economic system that, understood to its full extent, necessitates ""a legacy of erosion and floods,"" that doom these birds worth studying, stuffing and shipping around the world, to extinction.  Contextualizing duPont's book forces one to ackwnoledge the self-constructed nature versus industry dichotomy at the heart of the modern era.",10,4,"Philippine Birds, John Eleuthere du Pont,  Delaware Museum of Natural History; 1st edition (1971)",Philippine Birds: reading cycles of capitalism from a book of birds,2014-11-05T04:27:29+00:00,3,collections,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/collections/3,None,False,0,files,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/files?item=236,236,20,Thing,item_types,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/item_types/20,2014-12-03T16:39:41+00:00,3,users,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/users/3,True,None,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/items/236

52nd and Lancaster","July 29th, 1892","A.J. Cassatt formed the Lancaster Avenue Improvement Company to prevent trolley lines extending into the suburbs.

He totally rebuilds Lancaster Avenue between 52nd street and Paoli, making it a viable pathway to suburbia, yet""the remaining portion of the road, namely, that between Berwyn and Paoli, runs so close to the Pennsylvania Railroad that it is but little traveled and hence we have simply made such repairs upon it as were necessary to keep it safe."" In other words, Cassatt repairs the section of the road where his competitors want to build a trolley line, but doesn't rebuild the road where his company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, already has a presence. 

Formation of built environment dictated by economic interests of Cassatt. What might West Philadelphia have looked like had Cassatt not blocked the spread of public transportation to this region in 1889? This class might not exist if Lancaster Avenue only started in Paoli.

Spread of railroads, thanks to Pennsylvania Railroad company and A.J. Cassatt, sent Lancaster Avenue into disrepair, but due to economic competition they ultimately save this stretch of the road, perhaps keeping it viable until spread of automobiles makes the road relevant again some 50 years later.

“Out of a wilderness full of sunshine, vast plains, thick forests, velvety meadows, all covered with colorful skies, was our modern civilization born. 
Man the toiler of the lands on of the soil the slow moving human being twisted and turned, twitched and cracked until transformed to the mechanic, the builder, the creator, the laborer of to-day.
The vast planes thick forrests [sic] , velvety meadows disappeared miraculously over night. In their places, condensed populous cities, smoky factories, roaring elevator. Gigantic skyscrapers higher and higher, the wheel of machinery faster, faster, the noise and roar louder and louder. Higher, faster, louder faster no time to breathe, no time to think, no time to live, but on and on.
Produce, create, labor hard, harder, harder, old, outworn, out of order, out he goes. It s much cheaper to replace him, by a new young worker, robot, than to restore the old out worn body with new parts.
More and more goods were produced; a surplus of everything beginning with the necessities and ending with the beautiful things in the arts.
A customer was needed, a glutton to devour the surplus. Here was a huge bulk of thinkingless, feelingless, tasteless worker, robots on hand.
A movement started to introduce the bulk, the glutton to the fine and dainty things in life. The incredible happened.
The glutton awakened. It started to think, feel, develop a taste and desire for the fine and beautiful.
It started to demand the rights to live, and demanded more and more.
Disturbances occurred, but they were squelched. The masters were horrified, what had they done? They had put a human living soul in the robot. How take it back? [sic]
It was too late.
The worker-robot, dressed as a soldier, sailor, guardsman, had power for he was well trained to fight.
On a clear morning after a heavy storm, the sunbeams that succeeded in penetrating the thickly set skyscrapers, set eyes on the new masters.
Heavy set men with powerful muscles, sun burned and wind beaten faces. Hair tangled, but heads up, some what startled, a little frightened at the chaotic place they’d found.
Louder blew the whistle, cheerfully hissed the engine, faster and livelier turned the wheel of the machine. Robots happy.

West Philadelphia, PA",None,"Stanza from poem published in Lancaster Ave. News by Douglass Malloch, titled ""Virtue.""

They call it virtue--to set teeth,
        Square shoulders, wear a smile
When grief is gnawing underneath,
         Some sorrow, all the while.
They call it virtue--not to speak,
      Ask comfort, or complain,
Yes, even when the heart grows weak 
     With weariness or pain.

They call it virtue--yet I doubt
     If we need doubt so much
The brotherhood of those about
    We must not tell or touch
They call it virtue--thus to bear
     Our burdens all alone,
And yet I doubt if none would care,
   If other hearts are stone

They call it virtue--yet I know 
     The world is much more kind,
Is quick its fellowship to show 
   To burdened heart or mind.
They call it virtue--it may be
    A selfishness, a sin,
To doubt all human sympathy,
    And hide the hurt within

The havoc wreaked by Stock Market Crash demands reassessment of  nature of virtue itself.

","September, 1937","In 1937, Margaretta Hinchman strolled through Haverford's campus and recorded her impressions of several of the trees. Perhaps remembered hours later (it is unlikely she carried a typewriter with her), the wide range of observations is instructive to understanding the perception of nature along modern Lancaster Avenue.

Some entries are pseudo-scientific in their objectivity. Take the following: ""6. A Group of Elms — Six Elms, 3 English 3 American"" and ""2. Oak on Quad. — As Broad as it is Long."" Simulated nature allows for man to know and control the natural spaces around which would otherwise prove daunting in their vacuum-like meaninglessness.

Other entries read as charmingly absurd, such as ""8. White Pine, Entrance to Bird Sanctuary — The Birds' Xmas Candles which are lighted in June."" Even more entries exhibit a certain playfulness: ""4. Osage Orange — Playground of the Professor's Children"" and ""15. Group of Tulip Poplars — A shady nook that calls for a Book."" Since simulated nature is an environment controlled by man, what would otherwise be seen as a paranormal threat to the rational understandings of modernity becomes instead a benign flight of fancy. 

The distinction of simulated versus genuine natural space is recorded outright in Hinchman's observations as well. ""10. Two Tulips, — Nature's Gateposts, entrance to woods beyond the farm."" creates the cognitive divide between the two types of natural space by invoking the liminality of a gateway. The stark contrast between woods and farmland too serves to illuminate the vastly different experiences of genuinely natural versus simulated natural spaces.",10,5,"Margaretta S.

Tho’ of inconspicuous origin, and passing his earlier life among vagabonds, by strict attention to business and by his inborn common-sense, he gradually raised himself above his level. His character may be described as strictly materialistic and rationalistic—and this may be very well shown by his religious feelings. He judged religion by its effects on every-day life and conduct. Unlike his contemporaries he devoted more time to the study of earthly accomplishment than to the relation of man to eternity. Franklin gave a great deal of shrewd thought to the morals of this life, and compiled many popular aphorisms—also his list of virtues and ‘Rules of Conduct.’ His nature was not without humor—but of that kind which, as Macaulay says ‘throws a double portion of severity into his countenance while laughing inwardly.’”",7,4,"Christopher Morley, “The Character of Benjamin Franklin,” February 28, 1907.",The Character of Benjamin Franklin,2014-11-26T19:44:01+00:00,None,None,None,None,False,0,files,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/files?item=288,288,18,Person,item_types,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/item_types/18,2014-12-03T16:26:01+00:00,10,users,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/users/10,False,high-spirited triviality and the joke,http://ds.haverford.edu/lancasterproject/api/items/288
None,"October 28, 1907","Christopher Morley in college on daydreaming as idling: ""We should not let a day pass without both physical and mental exercise. But, just as rest is necessary after physical labor, so we need recreation and relaxation from mental strain. And where can we find this better than in day dreams? in this Poet’s No-Man’s Land of the imagination where we cast off the shackles of What Is and revel in delicious dreams of What Might Be.
	But day-dreams are properly of two kinds—those of the Idle Fancy, and Dreams of Unrealized Possibility, both of which let us glance at.
	In the dreams of Idle Fancy we become children again in spirit. We ourselves embody all our ideals—we imagine ourselves as heroes. These dreams have no correspondence in reality—there are merely the instinctive flight of the soul from the humdrum round of daily life. If not indulged in too extravagantly these dreams have a tonic and recreative effect on the mind.
	Daydreams of Unrealized possibility are rather different. They always look forward to the future, and deal with the actual realization of Ideals—they are possible. They are a mental stimulus and inspiration, and are really prophetic visions which contain “the seed of future good and future need.” And so we see that in our day-dreams we are able to get outside of ourselves and follow the sunset, so that we may always see the world bathed in a mellow golden splendor. Hard, cold, stern realities are laid aside, and our pleasure is bounded only by the confines of our imagination.""

""Miss Alice Rise, 18, of 5126 Hioopes street, a graduate from the Overbrook High School last June and who was taking an evening language course, was struck and injured fatally about 9 o'clock Monday night by an automobile as she started to run across Lancaster avenue, in front of the school near Fifty-ninth street.

Miss Rice, hurrying to avoid being late for class, did not see an automobile driven by Sivlio Martucci, 23 of Avon road, Ardmore, approaching. In the car with Martucci, was his brother, Pietro its ownder. 

Miss Rice was struck and knocked about twenty-five feet. A passing motorist took her to Misericordia Hospital where she died shortly before 10 o'clock as a result of internal injuries. Silvio Martucci was held for manslaughter and his brother was slated as a material witness.""",8,4,Lancaster Ave. News [Philadelphia] January 17. 1932. Print.,"""O.B. High School Student Killed""

When it came time for the boy to be discharged or moved to St. Francis (the orphan asylum for boys ages 12-18), what would he have packed in his suitcase then? 
The use of the suitcase aims to capture the transience of an orphan boy's existence as he is shuttled from place to place until he comes of age.

Exploring the possibilities of communal housing Wright built a beautiful four family home; the unique design affording each family dignity through private space. 

Built in 1939 as a planned one of four quadruple homes, the project was canceled due to the escalation of World War Two, and the complaint's of neighbors who opposed multi-family housing coming to Ardmore. 

The failure of the Suntop project actualized the failure of Wright's larger Broadacre project, and in a broader sense, the failure of suburbia. 

The Suntop homes inhabit an alternate reality where public, communal housing and intelligent suburban development flourished into more beautiful forms. They represent the glimmer of an un-actualized development peaking through our current history. 

Through this, they become a Benjaminian anecdote for what could have been. Capitalism produced Frank Lloyd Wright, offered beautiful urban planning, and instead that energy was thrown away amidst World War Two and the ensuring conflicts that literally sucked the lifeblood out of Wright's imagined possibilities.",10,5,"Lower Merion Conservancy

""[There was a] Russian Jewish girl, and just above her was a Southern cotton worker, and they were very antagonistic. And they both happened to be musical, and [the girl] from the south, (I forget the name of the Russian girl), but one of them began to play Russian folk songs. The American southern worker objected very much. She said she was terrible, she couldn’t stand the music. They were right over one over the other and it got to be quite a personal controversy…and finally, the Russian girl went and knocked on the door of the southern cotton mill worker, and asked her if she would teach her some of the southern folk songs. And, in return, finally, the cotton mill worker asked her to teach her some of the Russian folk songs. So you had this very good concert, both of them together. And they sang each others songs.”

",June 1983,"A summer school faculty member remembers: “The swimming pool at Bryn Mawr was presumably available for the summer school [sic]. But some limitations had been put on its use…the faculty was using the swimming pool fairly freely at various hours of the day and the students were not. Whether they were excluded is not clear to me but they, there were apparently some kind of separate and better privileges for faculty than for students. Some of the students, lead particularly by a recent lerman [sic] immigrant, protested and protested very vigorously. The result was that it was generally understood at the students’ insistence that there should be no faculty privileges not available to students and the result was of course that the pool was open to everyone on the same terms. I remember feeling some unease, or guilt, about the fact that I had used the pool under these early circumstances without much sense that I was depriving anybody of special privileges. I remember feeling that the student’s had thought faster and better than I had as a faculty member and I regretted this very much” ",4,4,"Transcript of interview with Alice Hanson Cook, 1983.

It is not a tragic face, because the eyes still glow with interest and soften with tolerance and understanding and the lips still smile genuinely and infectiously.

I feel as if my mind is cracking into pieces. My desire to learn is much greater than my mind can grasp. I feel as if time is rushing ahead of me, and I am almost out of breath to keep up. Some times I compare myself to a fertile soil which from lack of rain or sunshine had dried up a bit.

Often I ask myself, ""Is it not too late for me? Will the spirit of Bryn Mawr help me to continue or will the daily struggle devour me again and crush in me my last strife for education?""",4,4,"Kurstin, Rose. ""Never Before."" 1932.
