Data visualizations for a one-day workshop with Haverford students.

#### Installation
You can get this up quickly by using a simple Python server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or serving it up on any standard web server. If you run into any problems, contact Mike Tedeschi at mike@interactivemechanics.com.

#### Where our data came from
Data was pulled from the class Omeka API and transformed to CSV for cleaning. We pulled out the data that was of interest to us, specifically focusing on tags, dates, "Sense of the Modern", rarity, and descriptive written text. The data was cleaned and transformed in Excel before converted to JSON and CSV formats for D3.
